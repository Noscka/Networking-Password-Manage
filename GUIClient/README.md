# GUI Client
This is the GUI Client for the [Main Server](https://github.com/Ruski1/Networking-Password-Manage/tree/main/DOSServer). Currently it has really basic functionality of 
login, signup, logout, and chat with other users <br />

this is the first version and the design isn't the focus. Right now the main focus is to set up functionality and, if I continue this, in the second version, functionality will be the main focus
